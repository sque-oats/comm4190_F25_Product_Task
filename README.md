# comm4190_F25_Product_Task

Hi, welcome to our product task project repository! Our group members are Praachi and Suya.

For our chosen product, we decided to go with a solar-powered flashlight. As a pretty mundane object with its common audience being hikers and other outdoorsy people, we wanted to pursue unexpected directions with this product.

In our repository, there is one file per each member which contains each member's prompt iterations. After prompting for product directions, both members focused on their own concepts, culminating in two different webpages for products. One product was marketed as a luxrious and exclusive tool to wealthy audiences, and the other was marketed as a affordable self-defense object for women.
